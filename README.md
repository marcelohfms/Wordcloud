# Taylor Swift Lyrics Wordcloud implementation
In this project, we will use a database of Taylor Swift's song lyrics to create a wordcloud showing the most used words in her songs.
To achieve that, we will use a few libraries such as:
* os: for manipulating local directories
* re: for extraction of patterns in lyrics
* wordcloud: for creating the wordcloud object
* PIL: for creating an Image object and use it as mask for the wordcloud
* matplotlib: to plot the wordcloud
